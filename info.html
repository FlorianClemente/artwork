<p style="color:white; font-family:helvetica;" class="ex1">Florian Clemente</p>
<p style="color:white;" class="ex1"><i><span>artwork</span></i></p>
<p style="color:white;" class="ex2">I grew up in Munich where I studied Bioinformatics jointly at the Technical- and Ludwig-Maximilian University. My interests 
  in natural sciences and evolution led me to do a Ph.D. in <i>Population Genetics</i> in Vienna. It was during that time that I also became more 
  interested in arts, likely being influenced by the rich cultural program in Vienna. As a result, I started pencil drawing, mainly working
  on portraits and figures. After my graduation, my scientific career further brought me to Cambridge, UK as postdoctoral researcher and my artwork came
  to a halt. It was only during the time of my next postdoctoral position in Montpellier in the South of France that I rediscovered my passion for arts. There I 
  got to see landscapes and places around Arles, Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, of which <i>Vincent Van Gogh</i> painted some of his most 
  famous works. Seeing these original locations inspired me so much that, for the first time since school, I took a brush into my hands. Initially with acrylic 
  paint and later with oil colors, I tried to teach myself to handle a brush, aiming to pick up at least a bit of Vincent's so touching style. Over the last three years, 
  I have gained some experience and even though I might never be able to paint like Vincent, I hope that my artistic work will further improve and might find 
  its own way and justification.
