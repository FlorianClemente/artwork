<p style="color:white; font-family:helvetica;" class="ex1">Florian Clemente</p>
<p style="color:white;" class="ex1"><i><span>artwork</span></i></p>
<p style="color:white;" class="ex2">I grew up in Munich where I studied <i>Bioinformatics</i> jointly at the Technical University and Ludwig-Maximilian University. 
  My interests in natural sciences and evolution led me to do a Ph.D. in <i>Population Genetics</i> in Vienna. It was during this time that I also became 
  increasingly interested in art, likely due to the influence of the rich cultural program in Vienna. As a result I revived my pencil drawing, mainly focusing
  on acquiring skills for accomplishing portraits and figures. After my graduation, my scientific career brought me to Cambridge in the UK as a postdoctoral 
  researcher and my artwork came to a halt. It was only during my next postdoctoral position in Montpellier in the South of France that I rediscovered my passion 
  for art. There I got to see landscapes and places around Arles, Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, of which <i>Vincent Van Gogh</i> painted 
  some of his most famous works. Getting to know the actual locations where these paintings were made inspired me so much that for the first time since high 
  school, I decided to take a brush into my hands. Initially with acrylic paint and later with oil colors, I tried to teach myself, aiming to pick up at least a 
  bit of Vincent's so touching style. During the last three years I have gained some experience in this, and even though I might never be able to paint like 
  Vincent himself, the progress I can see in my paintings keeps me motivated to continue. I hope that my artwork will further improve and develop such that 
  one day, it might find its own way and justification.
