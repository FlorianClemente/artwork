 <h4 style="color:white;">My passion for painting started while living in the South of France, where I got inspired by encountering many 
  of the original landscapes eternalized by Vincent Van Gogh. Initially, I taught myself to paint by 
  trying to replicate some of Vincent's works or borrowing some of his ideas and combining them with mine. More recently, 
  I have also gained experience in other painting styles and I am curious to see where this is going to lead to...

<h4 style="color:white;">"This morning I still have a lot of work to do, I see that it isn't easy and will no doubt become much more difficult,
  yet have unfaltering hope that I'll learn to work by working, and that my work will become better and more substantial." - "But the way to do it better later
  is to do it as well as one can today, there can't be anything but progress tomorrow." - Vincent Van Gogh
